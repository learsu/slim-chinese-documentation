# Overview

The Slim Framework is a tiny dispatcher. It routes an HTTP request to the appropriate callback code, and it returns an HTTP response. Slim also provides complementary features like middleware, sessions, flash messaging, HTTP caching, views, and hooksâ€”we'll discuss these later.

## Mission Statement

The Slim Framework provides easy-to-understand tools to build simple yet powerful web applications and APIs.
